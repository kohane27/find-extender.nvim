This Plugin extend's the capability of **find** and **till** and **text manipulation** commands.

## ‚ú® Features

- supports prefix: you can use this to not let this plugin hijack the default finding commands.
- extends the find characters limit to `2` characters form `1`.
- adds support for yank/delete/change(y/d/c) commands has same behaviour like finding
  commands.
- Repeat the last pattern using `;` and `,` commands.
- Accepts count before commands.
- Adds movements to navigate through the matches. Two type of movements are
  supported:
  - **leap**: this movement is inspired from [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim),
    this movement lets you pick the match by picking virtual text symbol assigned to it.
  - **lh**: this movement will allow you to move through matches using `h` and `l` keys.
    This movement acts as a mode and provides some useful features:
    - count is accepted and can be used to move faster between multiple matches.
    - adds support for `$`, `0` and `^` motions like normal mode but this moves you through matches.
- Lets you ignore certain characters. Using this feature you can use default `1`
  character search for certain characters like punctuations(`{`,`(`,`,`, etc).

Text Manipulation(yank/delete/change) command's are also supported, only if the second
key after y/d/c keys is either one of `t|T` or `f|F` command's. That means it won't
hijack the movements like `{c|d|y}w`, `{c|d|y}e`, etc.

üî• This Plugins Effects the following commands:

```
f|F (find commands)
t|T (till commands)
;|, (repat last pattern commands)
c{t|T|f|f} (change command)
d{t|T|f|f} (delete command)
y{t|T|f|f} (yank command)
```

After pressing any of these commands, now you have to type `2` characters rather than `1`
to go to next match.

## Commands

There are three commands available.

- FindExtenderDisable
- FindExtenderEnable
- FindExtenderToggle

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### prefix

Use a **prefix** key same as `<leader>` key to activate the finding Commands.

Although i wouldn't recommend this because this plugin was developed to
compliment default finding commands. And using this instead of default find
command's makes you more efficient in movement. But its up to you to decide.

```lua
---@field prefix table if you don't want this plugin to hijack the default
--- finding commands use a prefix to use this plugin.
prefix = {
  key = "g",
  enable = false,
},
```

### ignore case

You can ignore case of your search by setting this to `true`

```lua
---@field ignore_case boolean whether to ignore case or not when searching
ignore_case = false,
```

### movements

Movements allow you to move through matches.
This plugin allows tow types of movements.

1. Leap like movement, by picking match like [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim).
2. lh this movement allows you to move through matches using the `l` and `h` keys
   You can pick your desired match by pressing keys defined in the
   `actions_keys.accept` table on that match. This acts like a mode you can do
   motions like `$`, `0` and `^` like in normal mode but these motions will only
   move you through the matches.
   Some useful features provided in this movement are:
   - count is accepted and can be used to move faster between multiple matches.
   - adds support for `$`, `0` and `^` motions like normal mode but this moves you through matches.

```lua
movements = {
  ---@field min_matches number minimum number of matches required after which
  --- you can use the leap or lh.
  min_matches = 1,
  ---@field highlight_match table highlights the match
  highlight_match = { fg = "#c0caf5", bg = "#545c7e" },
  ---@field lh table this lets you move though the matches using `l` and `h` keys.
  lh = {
    enable = false,
    ---@field lh_curosr_hl table highlight the cursor for the `lh` movement
    cursor_hl = { fg = "#545c7e", bg = "#ff9e64" },
    ---@field action_keys table
    action_keys = {
      ---@field accept table of keys that will trigger the accept action
      accept = { "<CR>", "n" },
      ---@field escape table of keys that will trigger the escape action
      escape = { "<ESC>", "j", "k" },
      ---@field accept_and_feed table accept the current match and feed this key
      accept_and_feed = { "i", "a" },
    },
  },
  ---@field leap table pick match, with virtual text symbol for that match.
  leap = {
    enable = true,
    ---@field symbols string virtual text symbols, that represent matches
    symbols = "abcdefgh",
  },
},
```

##### Matches highlighting

You can highlight the match position by changing he color of `highlight_match`
key in config.

```lua
---@field highlight_match table highlights the match
highlight_match = { fg = "#c0caf5", bg = "#545c7e" },
```

The `lh` movement cursor can also be customized by changing the `lh.curosr_hl` key.

```lua
---@field lh_curosr_hl table highlight the cursor for the `lh` movement
lh.curosr_hl = { fg = "#545c7e", bg = "#c0caf5" },
```

### `no_wait`

Don't for second char if the first one is present in this table.

```lua
---@field no_wait table don't wait for second char if one of these is the first
--- char, very helpful if you don't wait to enter 2 chars if the first one
--- is a punctuation.
no_wait = {
  "}",
  "{",
  "[",
  "]",
  "(",
  ")",
  ",",
},

```

### ‚å® keymaps

Keymaps are exposed to user, if any key you want to remove just remove it from the
table.

```lua
keymaps = {
  ---@field finding table finding keys config
  finding = {
    ---@field modes string modes in which the finding keys should be added.
    modes = "nv",
    ---@field till table table of till keys backward and forward both by default.
    till = { "T", "t" },
    ---@field find table table of find keys backward and forward both by default.
    find = { "F", "f" },
  },
  ---@field text_manipulation table information about text manipulation keys including yank/delete/change.
  text_manipulation = {
    ---@field yank table keys related to finding yanking area of text in a line.
    yank = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
    ---@field delete table keys related to finding deleting area of text in a line.
    delete = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
    ---@field change table keys related to finding changing area of text in a line.
    change = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
  },
},
```

### Finding keys

Keys related to finding text. Remove any of the key you want to disable.
modes is a string with the modes name initials.

```lua
---@field finding table finding keys config
finding = {
  ---@field modes string modes in which the finding keys should be added.
  modes = "nv",
  ---@field till table table of till keys backward and forward both by default.
  till = { "T", "t" },
  ---@field find table table of find keys backward and forward both by default.
  find = { "F", "f" },
},
```

### text_manipulation

Mappings related to the text manipulation change, delete and yank(copy).
If you want to disable any of these keys then remove key from the table.

```lua
-- to delete, copy or change using t,f or T,F commands
text_manipulation = {
  ---@field yank table keys related to finding yanking area of text in a line.
  yank = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
  ---@field delete table keys related to finding deleting area of text in a line.
  delete = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
  ---@field change table keys related to finding changing area of text in a line.
  change = { "f", "F", "t", "T" },
},
```

### highlight on yank

These options control the highlight when yanking text.

```lua
highlight_on_yank = {
  -- whether to highlight the yanked are or not
  enable = true,
  -- time for which the area will be highlighted
  timeout = 40,
  -- highlight the yanked text
  hl = { bg = "#565f89" },
}
```
